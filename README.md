	    ]
    }

Please note:

         "category":"Category1",
         "links":[
            {
               "name":"Link1",
               "url":"http://example.com"
            },
            {
               "name":"Link2",
               "url":"http://example.com",
               "target":"optionals"
            }
         ]
      },
      {
         "category":"Category2",
         "links":[
            {
               "name":"Link1",
               "url":"http://example.com"
            },
            {
               "name":"Link2",
               "url":"http://example.com"
            }
         ]
      }
   ]
}
```
Add names for the categories you wish to define and add the bookmarks for each category.

Please note:

 - No `http://` in the URL
 - No `,` at the end of the last bookmark in a category and at the end of the last category


#### Color themes
These can be added or customized in the themer.js file. When changing the name of a theme or adding one, make sure to edit this section in index.html accordingly:

```
    <section  class="themes">
```

I might add a simpler way to edit themes at some point, but adding the current ones should be pretty straight forward.
